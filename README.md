## SafeHaven

Discreet support for survivors of domestic violence.

SafeHaven is a web application designed with the utmost priority on user privacy and safety. It appears and functions as a standard calculator, providing a discreet way for survivors of domestic violence to access critical resources without leaving a suspicious footprint on their devices.

## How It Works

1.  Sign Up: A new user first creates an account through a three-step process: entering basic info, setting a secret PIN, and adding an initial emergency contact.
2.  Log In: The user is presented with the calculator interface. They enter their secret PIN and press the `=` button to log in.
3.  Access Resources: Once logged in, the user is taken to their private dashboard, where they can access the safety plan, find help, and view educational resources. All information they save is stored securely in their browser.

## Key Features
